JavaScript : - it is use to add functionality and bahavior into webapp
             - it is interpreted language
             - it is loosely typed language

* there are 2 ways to use JavaScript

1.internal js : in html file we use script and in that script we write js code
2.external js : first we create a seperate js file and that js file we import in html file by using script tag

*how to display output in js

1. document.write(); : it will display output on webpage . it display output in single line
2.window.alert(); : it will generate one pop-up window and display output in it
3.console.log(); : it will give output in browser control or in terminal
4.innerHtml(DOM); : it allows us to insert data inside an element

DOM (Document Object Model)

-in JavaScript window is global object 
-by using DOM how to set,get value from element
- how to apply style rule to an element by using DOM

*function :
- it is block of code, which is use to perform specific task
-it will execute only when we call it

*there are mainly 2 types of function

1. predefined : provided by JavaScript
2. user defined : created by user

*how to get values from input control
*how to use onclick event

2009 (ECMA script-5) :
2015 (ECMA script-6) :

*data types in js

there are 2 types of datatype
1.primitive datatype : number,string,boolean,undefined,null
2.non-primitive datatype : array,object

*array : 
- it is use to store multiple values with same datatype in single variable
- in array values store on index basis
- array index always start from 0 index
- array denoted by [] bracket
- we can access

*array length : total number of values available in it

syntax : arrayname.length

*array size : total numberof index
syntax : arrayname.length-1

*array methods 

*object datatype : it is use to store multiple values with different datatype in single variable
-it is use to- in object data store in ket and value pair formate
-we can access object data outside for that we write object.keyname
-object denoted by {}



callback function: passing one function as an argument inside another function 

*settimeout : it will call another method only once after perticular time interval
            - it takes 2 parameter , 1.callback function, 2.time in millisecond

*setinterval method : it will call another method multiple time after perticular time interval
                     - it takes 2 parameter , 1.callback function, 2.time in millisecond

*date and its method :
- if you want to get date and time in web page by using js for that first we have to create object of date class

in js date and class return date and time from browser
synatax :
           let dateObj=new Date()

sun=0,monday=1,.........sat=6
jan=0,...........dec=11

how to set date and time

let date= new date(year,month,date,hours,second,millisecond)

js is executed on both side client side and server side
nodejs is used to js to execute on server side


* exponentiation operator : it will return power of any number (**)

== : it check only value,if values are same then it return true result
=== : it check both value and datatype ,if both are same it return true result
ex : 
5==5
true

'5'==5
true

'5'===5
false

5===5
true

* hoisting : it is js default behavior which moves variable and function declaration at top of tha page
            means , we can use variable before declaration of it

difference between var, let, and const

var : it support hoisting concept 
      we can use variable before declaration of it
      we can re-declare it

let : it don't support hoisting concept
      we cannot use variable before decalartion of it
      we can re-declare it

const : it is used to create variable with const value 
        when we declare const variable at same time we have to initilize it 
        const variable value will never change on run time

*math method : it is used to perform mathematical operations
                 provide inbuild method

math.ceil(5.6)=>6
math.ceil(5.1)=>6
math.floor(5.8)=>5
math.floor(5.1)=>5
math.round(5.4)=>5
math.round(5.5)=>6
math.round(5.9)=>6
math.random()=>0.0122844724108
math.random()=>0.8862682087572

String and its method
- it is collection of character
- in string every leter has index number
-character index from 0 index
-in string blank space is also consider as string

*how to find index of searching string
1. indexOf("search-string",index?) : it will return index of first occurance of searching string
              it will search string left to right direction
              if searching string is not found then it return -1 result

2. lastIndexOf ("search-string",index?) : it will return index of first occurance of searching string
              it will search string right to left direction
              if searching string is not found then it return -1 result

3.search ("search-string"): it will return index of first occurance of searching string
              it will search string left to right direction
              if searching string is not found then it return -1 result
              it is faster than indexOf methed

*how to find part of string from big string 
4.slice(start-index,end-index): it will return partial part of string from index number
                               - it will search string from left to right when we pass positive index
                               - it will search string from right to left when we pass negative index

5.subString: (start-index,end-index): it will return partial part of string from index number
                               - it will search string from left to right when we pass positive index

6.subStr (start-index,total-numberOf-character):it will return partial part of string from index number
                               - it will search string from left to right when we pass positive index

7. split(seperator) : it is use to converting string data into array

8.replace("oldText","newText") : 

9.charAt(index) : it return single character available on index number


ES5 (ECMA script5)2009 :

1."use stric" : it execute js code in strict mode, in this we can not use variable before declaration of it
              it always right at starting of js code

2. trim() : it is used to remove unwanted white space from both side of string


-for each
-map
-filter
-every
-some
-reduce or reduceRight


*propt : it generate one popup window and allows user to insert data in it

*external js


*form validation
*perform form validation after submitting form
- for this we use onsubmit event

-
*perform form validation before submittingform
-for this we use onblur event

* how to merge 2 or more arrays
1. by using concat method
2. by using spread operator

*destructuring : creating constant variable and storing data in it
                 we can destructure array and object data
