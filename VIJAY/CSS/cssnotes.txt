q. what are the types of css?
q.how many ways you can use css?

=> there are three ways to use css

1. inline css: in starting tag we write style attribute with property and value
2. internal css : in html file we use style tag and in that we write css code
                    syntax : selector{
                        property : value;
                        property : value;
                    }
3. external css : in this we create a seperate css file and that css file we import in html file by using link tag
                    syntax : selector{
                         property : value;
                        property : value;
                    }      

* selector in css : selecting the element

1. element name selector : in this we use element name to apply css property
2. group selector : we can make a group of selectors name

         - because every element has by default position:static thats why element will never move after
         applying left ,right,top and bottom value

         position : static;  default
         position : relative;   // element can move by using left ,right,top and bottom value
         position absolute : when we want child element must move according its parent element
                            - in this case parent element must have position:relative and child element must have position:absolute

         position : sticky : it is use to stick element to screen border

         z-index : it is use to decide stack property of an element
                   it has 2 value 1 and -1
